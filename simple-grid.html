                                The architecture is absolutely amazing. One place without a doubt i will vacation to is Tokyo.
                                The fashion sense is absolutely exquisite. 
                                If They is one place i would gladly visit without a doubt surely is Tokyo my first destination of choice. I love the food but most importantly the philospphy practice of spirituality. 
                            Their authenticity to culture and religion is absolutely none compared and the practice of ancient history that has yielded positive result both politicaly and phycologically</p>
